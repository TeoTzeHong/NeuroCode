# Idea
Documentation in software development is often slow to write, difficult to read, and hard to maintain. Our idea is to build a smart documentation assistant that makes the entire process easier, faster, and always up to date.

For collaboration, the tool supports role-based access. Each team member can be assigned a role such as Owner, Frontend, Backend, or Database. Team members can edit only their own sections, while the Owner has full access and decides which changes to merge into the final version. When a teammate makes edits, the Owner can clearly see them in a dedicated column that tracks changes, ensuring transparency about what each teammate has contributed before approval. The tool also notifies users whenever updates are made, so the entire team stays informed.

With these features, documentation becomes smarter because it is linked to code and easy to search, faster because it is AI-assisted and summarized, and more maintainable because it stays in sync with code changes while supporting structured collaboration.
