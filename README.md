# Idea
Documentation in software development is often slow to write, hard to read, and difficult to maintain. Our idea is to build a smart documentation assistant that makes the whole process easier, faster, and always up to date.


For collaboration, the tool supports role-based access. Each team member can be assigned a role such as Owner, Frontend, Backend, or Database. Team members can edit only their own section, while the Owner has full access and decides what changes to merge into the final version. When a teammate edits something, the Owner can clearly see what was edited in a column that tracks the changes, making it transparent what each teammate has done before approval. The tool also notifies users when something changes, so the whole team stays updated.

With these features, documentation becomes smarter because it is linked to code and easy to search, faster because it is AI-assisted and summarized, and maintainable because it stays in sync with code changes and supports structured collaboration.
